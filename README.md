# Description

In this program, all the csv files in a directory will be merged into one csv file. The columns in the csv files can be renamed and selected before a final output csv file is created with the combined data of the csv files in a chosen directory. A Tkinter GUI is used to allow useres to select the input folder. Once you click on the "Create" button, an output csv file is created in the "Output" folder in the root of the program.
